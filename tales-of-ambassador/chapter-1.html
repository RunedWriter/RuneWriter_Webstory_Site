    <h1>A 'Warm' Welcome</h1>

    <p class="intro">For Aeteria is is the year 312 of the Unified Era, it has been over two decades since the war against the symbiants began. Now, the Cuthian tribes, seeing the potential for genuine change in the galaxy, send a representative to Aeteria to seek to understand the new power. Will the wanderers of their people, and the many other vestiges of old beings that traverse the empty expanse amongst the stars find a new hope in the 'humans' of Aeteria? Or will these militant upstarts prove more a poison than a cure? This tale follows Tyr Iffyn, an elder wise enough to be trusted for the role, but not vital enough to be a grave loss. His experience and time with humanity will prove to be the most wild, dangerous, and rewarding experience of his life.</p>

    <p>"We welcome you, Tyr Iffyn, representative of the Cuthians and 'Weaver of knowledge' to the Aeterian-Cuthian embassy. I trust your journey was safe and uneventful?"</p>

    <p>The human who spoke was a male, 'Mr Thomas' so he'd introduced himself. The behavioral overview in my Augmented Reality described the facial expression as 'cautiously hospitable', a promising first reaction given what little we'd come to know of the Aeterians.</p>

    <p>"As your kind says, the pleasure is mine Mr Thomas. I look forward to working with you and learning of your people. Creation permitting, we will find a means of lasting cooperation against the Symbiant threat."</p>

    <p>"Of course, any <em>trustworthy</em> ally is more than welcome. Regretfully that reality will have to wait until our people better understand each other. I understand your tribes first and foremost wanted to be assured of the freedoms our people experience, and for clarification on our military ideology?"</p>

    <p>That was putting it mildly. How had these intergalactic newcomers both seen through the proselytizing envoys, and then survived the militant onslaught of the Symbiant? Few newborns survived the first year of conflict, quickly finding themselves a part of the collective. Yet these 'Humans' had slaughtered so many waves of assault that the Symbiant had to mobilize for war for the first time in centuries. Our spy drones had been forced to operate at extreme local distance to avoid detection and their findings were mortifying. Work cycles in excess of 2/3rds of their planetary's rotation. Tactics and maneuvers that were anathema to galactic war doctrine. Unwavering courage in battle, and next to no civil unrest. Many in the tribe feared the humans were a collective that had branched off from the Symbiant proper, but in response to allowing us access to a convicted criminal to inspect human anatomy -in the least harmful and invasive way of course- we found no sign whatsoever of hive mind, symbiote, or parasitic involvement.</p>

    <p>"That is correct, and I have been made aware of and am willing to take part in your non-intrusive analysis of Cuthian biology with your doctors as well. Thank you again for understanding our desire to ensure no potential symbiant involvement exists within your species."</p>

    <p>"It is an understandable concern. Fortunately our scanners have already proven to our satisfaction that you are clean of any external influence, so we can begin the tour immediately. Thank you as well for allowing us access to your own symbiant scanners. Reverse engineering them has allowed us to improve our non-human scanning significantly. The schematics of our improvements have been transferred to your people and your personal ship as agreed. Now, the first part of our tour will involve the non-classified military training. Will you require any accommodation?"</p>

    <p>"Only as much as an unaugmented human would be expected to need. Based on our current understanding of your biology."</p>

    <p>Mr. Thomas expression changed into a 'forced smile' at that. I'll have to bear in mind going forward that apparently even if they are willing to give up prisoners designated for capital punishment, humans appear to still have empathy for the fate of their condemned.</p>

    <p>"I apologize, it appears I have made a poor remark. I do trust your people received the returned prisoner and that they found her in acceptable condition?"</p>

    <p>"... Yes, we received her safely. I am... thankful that it appears your people took great care in your investigation to not cause undue harm. However, as her experience was so tranquil, there were too many in the council who felt her penance unpaid for the crimes accused and she... unfortunately... was only rewarded with a reduced sentence to life's indenturement, instead of capital punishment. It is a severe punishment, and while it is far better than death. Our people value our freedom highly."</p>

    <p>So the sympathy wasn't over what we had done, but rather a correlated distaste brought up by conversation of the topic. A trait good to know going forward. It is also good that there appears to be no slight taken in our care. What little we do know of these humans is that they have proven fiercely protective of their kind, while being stunningly willing to put themselves and their kind at risk in the same breath. I will have to remain cautious indeed.</p>

    <p>"My sympathies, a value of one's own freedom is something we share. I cannot imagine having to give up my own, regardless of the crime. I know many of my people would prefer a more final alternative. Those of us that remain free, at least. Let us proceed, I am excited to learn more of your people. I truly believe that this is the start of a long a nd prosperous friendship between our kind."</p>

    <p>"I could hope for nothing more myself. To the future, Elder Tyr Iffyn!"</p>

    <p>"To the future, and to freedom!"</p>

    <p>And with that, my appointment to Humanity was accepted, and my mission truly began.</p>
