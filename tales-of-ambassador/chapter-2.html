    <h1>Cruel and Unusual Training</h1>
    <!--Thoughts for chap 2. It's going to involve the military tour, so lets brainstorm over what will be used as training in Aeteria. Given cybernetic augmentations are common, as is the advancement of base biology through combat elixir lets have it be a kind of combination of AR and physical training. Principles being maintaining constant high levels of accuracy and movement while over-encumbered and running scenarios where success is impossible as the difficulty just scales with time. 
    
    The soldiers are provided meals, and have means to sleep however their waking moments are nearly entirely designed around training to failure. Each finished simulation allows a break for respite and sleep, then it's back in. The time of break is kept somewhat to the soldiers, however they pass only when they are able to last a certain time, and their rank, responsibility, and initial career standing are tied to it. Breaks that are more than necessary are rare, particularly with the atmosphere encouraged in commons. -->
    <p>Note from author: This chapter is still being edited.</p>

    <p>It was an hour of Earth time, or 60 standard units for us to reach the Aeterian training facility. By a twist of fate, the Earth minutes matched near perfectly with standard galactic measurement for time. Earth's day, approximately 1,440 units was almost half again as long as the standard cycle for Cuthians. This had made the revelation of their 1k unit long work shifts all the more alarming.</p>

    <p>The facility itself was unimposing from the outside. A fortified entrance that began in an underground highway used by the local city. From the surface there was no indication at all of a military complex, and the town it was established in was large enough to accommodate a large garrison, but still small enough to not be considered a key target in a campaign.</p>

    <p>We had three layers of checkpoints to go through before our convoy was in the training grounds proper. Clearances, inspections, and redundant screenings were done for things like contraband or espionage devises. I'd been made aware before hand, and while it wasn't exactly pleasant, the humans were matter-of-fact about it and the experience was over with in about 30 units. After we were finally in, Mr. Thomas apologized with a wry expression.</p>

    <p>"Sorry, I would imagine it's not a pleasant experience to be looked over with a fine toothed comb by species you've just met, but it was the only way we could get you access. Now, allow me to start the tour in earnest."
    </p>

    <p>I was led to an overlook that showed a multi-level sea of simulation chambers with transparent walls. The bottom level was made up of rooms for individuals or pairs. Where even from this distance I could see humans training with artificial weapons of war. The ground inside the rooms was malleable and changed constantly to presumably reflect what the soldiers in training were seeing within their visors. For some, the 'ground' had taken the shape of vehicles and the trainees were practicing aggressive maneuvers and activities, often being thrown into the walls, that bent and absorbed the impact.</p>

    <p>The second level was for squadron or small group training, and the third level was giant rooms that showed grand battlezones happening. From urban warfare, to simulated space combat, and all manner of in between by the look of it. Thousands were each going through training tailored and platforms moved people up and down through the levels regularly. Siphoning out collapsed cadets and moving others from one simulation to the next. From the number of people I saw hitting walls and ceilings from simulated impacts and knock back. It was clear whatever the simulations were depicting was no mere skirmish. This presumption was reinforced by semi-constant trickle of stretchers that hauled off cadets to medical bays that lined the walls on every level.</p>

    <p>"Is today a particularly unusual day of training? You seem to be putting your cadets through rather... extreme conditions no?"</p>

    <p>I made an attempt to keep the disapproval out of my tone, it seemed cruel and foolish to allow so many promising cadets to suffer what by the look of it, while not life threating, significant injury. A trial such as this one generally reserved for the final test in a warriors journey. To show their mettle and courage. It was not the intensity I would expect to benefit the inexperienced on their path to learning.</p>

    <p>"Not at all, this is where the bulk of training is held. Our cadets will typically spend 12 weeks in general combat training. and varied additional time in training for even more advanced roles like pilots, captains, demolition, hell-jumpers, etc. Each cadet's gear is shock absorbent, and combined with the walls few injuries are able to become long term. The lads get roughed up plenty, but nothing that won't do them good in the long run. Sweat in training, rather than bleed on the field."</p>
