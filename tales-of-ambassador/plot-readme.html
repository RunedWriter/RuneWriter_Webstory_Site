    <h1>Plot overview</h1>

    <p>With tales of the ambassador changed to be in the Aeterian Universe. I think the best plot aspect will be that we are starting after each faction knows of each other and rather than focus on how they discovered or how ftl got out we will start from the planning of delegation with the point being that the first/main 'alien' faction is reaching out to understand the galactic power that has avoided converting themselves to living purely in space and is standing openly against the symbiants. Where humanity is determining if there is potential for aid, trade, or a need to brace for additional opposition after discovering that there is more than the symbiant threat out in the galaxy. </p>
